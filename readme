===========
Small note:
If you don't understand why certain words were chosen - I will try to explain it here.
These translations highly rely on non-Krapiva dictionaries. And non-russian words. That means that they are not that commonly used nowadays.
Nowadays people usually speak and write in russified version of belarusian called Narkamauka and use words taken from russian (even though we have our own).
So if you see an unfamiliar word try researching it in dictionaries first.
The additions are welcome, but before deleting or changing something try to understand why it is there in the first place.
! DO NOT use Krapiva dictionary. !
! NEVER use Krapiva dictionary to translate things. !
! DO NOT use Krapiva dictionary at all. !

List of acceptable dictionaries (from top to bottom, the best are at the top):
https://slounik.org/bn
https://slounik.org/nb
https://slounik.org/stanbr
https://slounik.org/rbSauka
https://slounik.org/starbiel
https://slounik.org/lahojsk
https://slounik.org/bulykarb [USE WITH CAUTION]
https://slounik.org/bulykabr [USE WITH CAUTION]
Of course you can use other dictionaries, but these are the most reliable.

!! IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT TEXTS IN THE GAME (Tutorials, etc.):
You won't be able to see words such as "Ty", "Vy" (and their forms); "Pryvitańnie"; "Havaryć" in the in-game texts, because these are maskalisms.
The list of acceptable alternatives: "Sam", "Vaša" (and their forms); various other hellos; "Mović".
I can't force you into using these, but to maintain general "code style" so to speak, if you'd use alternatives that I have written instead - that would be wonderful.

!! IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT STRANGE WORDS: ItemName_BE.txt and GameSound_BE.txt may be absolutely illogical in some places. That's fine. If you see something like. "Папяровы шкляначку" - correct it.
This happens because of our last-resort way of dealing with big files.

!!! WE NEVER USE TRANSLATORS TO TRANSLATE THINGS. ONLY DICTIONARIES.
