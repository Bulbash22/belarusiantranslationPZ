Small note:
If you don't understand why certain words were chosen - I will try to explain it here.
These translations highly rely on non-Krapiva dictionaries. And non-russian words. That means that they are not that commonly used nowadays.
Nowadays people usually speak and write in russified version of belarusian called Narkamauka and use words taken from russian (even though we have our own).
So if you see an unfamiliar word try researching it in dictionaries first.
The additions are welcome, but before deleting or changing something try to understand why it is there in the first place.
DO NOT use Krapiva dictionary.
NEVER use Krapiva dictionary to translate things.
DO NOT use Krapiva dictionary at all.

List of acceptable dictionaries (from top to bottom, the best are at the top):

https://slounik.org/starbiel
https://slounik.org/lahojsk
https://slounik.org/bulykarb [USE WITH CAUTION]

Of course you can use other dictionaries, but these are the most reliable.

!! IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT TEXTS IN THE GAME (Tutorials, etc.):
You won't be able to see words such as "Ty", "Vy" (and their forms); "Pryvitańnie"; "Havaryć" in the in-game texts, because these are maskalisms.
The list of acceptable alternatives: "Sam", "Vaša" (and their forms); various other hellos; "Mović".

!! IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT A SHADY SCHEME: YES YES YES YES IT IS FULLY TRANSLATED!!!!! ItemName_BE.txt DONE!!!!!!!
So. I came up with a shady scheme. I decided to "speed up our progress" by fully translating files through an online translator.
What I thought was: "Oh, we are just going to correct it, clean up the trash and move on to the next files". I was deeply mistaken.
It produced the translation of such an awful quality - that I wanted to jump out of my window. And correcting it was a pain.
So if you see something... Out of place (except for "Сьмешны яблык", don't touch that), that is not taraskevica - it was probably done by an online translator and missed out by us on correction stage.
Right now there is only one file that suffered the same fate and is yet to be corrected GameSound_BE.txt

!!! WE NEVER USE TRANSLATORS TO TRANSLATE THINGS. ONLY DICTIONARIES.
