Small note:
If you don't understand why certain words were chosen:
These translations highly rely on non-Krapiva dictionaries and non-russian words. That means that they are not that commonly used nowadays.
So if you see an unfamiliar word try researching it in the recommended dictionaries first.
The additions are welcomed, but before deleting or changing something try to understand why it was put there in the first place.
! DO NOT use Krapiva dictionary. !
! NEVER use Krapiva dictionary to translate things. !
! DO NOT use Krapiva dictionary at all. !
