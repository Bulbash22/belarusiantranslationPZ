Belarusian (be-tarask) translation files for Project Zomboid

===========
Small note:
If you don't understand why certain words were chosen:
These translations highly rely on non-Krapiva dictionaries and non-russian words. That means that they may not be that commonly used nowadays.
So if you see an unfamiliar word - try researching it in the recommended dictionaries, archives and other translations beforehand.
The additions are welcomed, but before deleting or changing something try to understand why it was put there in the first place.
On some very rare occasions you may encounter neologisms - they were used in places, where the traditional boundaries of the language ended.
The use of dialectal words is encouraged if it diversifies and improves the overall quality of the translation.
! DO NOT use Krapiva dictionary. !
! NEVER use Krapiva dictionary to translate things. !
! DO NOT use Krapiva dictionary at all. !
